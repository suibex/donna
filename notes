donna v4.0
actually more like qira but whatever.
it has to first have banker system that is going to decrypt back the instructions.
everything else is just an addon

how do we find the instruction?
example:
0101 0010 1000 0000 0000 0010 1001 1010 <-fetched binary number
xxx1 1010 1x0m mmmm xx1x 10nn nnnd dddd  -  asrv Rd Rn Rm <- example from arm64.bank
compare first three "numbers"
but skip everything that isnt 1 or 0
